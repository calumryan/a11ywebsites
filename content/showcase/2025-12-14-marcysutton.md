Marcy's website is a good example of combining strong accessibility and design: it features a clear navigational structure, high-contrast colours, and clean, legible fonts. The prominent skip links, placed both in the top header and immediately before the level 1 heading, are a slightly uncommon design choice but make it easier to return to the primary navigation menu on each page.
