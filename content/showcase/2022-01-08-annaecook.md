Accessibility designer Anna Cook has a portfolio site of their work, blog posts and speaking engagements. Overall it meets grade AA. Heading and layout structure is present in a logical order. Judging by the swift transitions between pages, this is a Single Page Application site. Page titles update in time with each transition to a different page, and users can navigate back and forward between pages using standard keys or controls. It would be great to see more content brought within the site for the blog section from external sites which aren't as accessible.
