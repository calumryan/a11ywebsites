Hilfsgemeinschaft (support community) website almost meets grade AA overall with a significant amount of accessibility enhancements that may be useful for users unfamiliar with built-in assistive technologies, such as screen readers and system display preferences. Failures include missing keyboard operable access to some form controls and reflow issues on the homepage due to controls/content in the slider not being visible when reducing the viewport size.
