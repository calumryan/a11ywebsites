Unsurprisingly, the A11Y Project site meets grade AA overall, complemented by an attractive design and colour palette. Indeed it goes further than that in terms of best practice approaches for accessibility for things such as navigational aids and high contrast colours in some locations. Aside from grading its level of accessibility compliance, A11Y Project is a fantastic site to keep on revisiting, with a huge archive of up-to-date content and links to resources to learn more about digital accessibility.
