Lucid Fox meets grade AA overall. Areas that could be tweaked and improved: the footer is contained inside another footer landmark which might cause some confusion for some screen reader users. Additionally, some headings use a gradient background for text colour which periodically transitions to bright orange, that could arguably fail an audit on colour contrast.
