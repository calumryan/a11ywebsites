LÃ©onie's website makes good use of well contrasting colours, structure and landmarks. All links are underlined and focus states have additional styling to make them clear. Toggle buttons for blog post archives are correctly coded with Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) allowing for easier keyboard navigation. The colour contrast ratios are excellent meaning it caters for all kinds of vision impairment along with a preference option for light and dark modes.
