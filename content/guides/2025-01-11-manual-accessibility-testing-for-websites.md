## Why do manual accessibility testing?
To make a website as accessible as possible, we must prioritise testing with users and regularly perform manual tests throughout the lifetime of a website. It helps us to identify accessibility issues early on, hopefully before they become a barrier for our users. Manual testing also offers a different perspective for everyone involved in testing so that we're able to experience some of the differences of using a website when using assistive technology and or customised configurations.
