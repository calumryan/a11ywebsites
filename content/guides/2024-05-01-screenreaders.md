## Why testing with screen readers is important
People with a visual impairment or cognitive impairments, such as dyslexia, rely on screen readers to read aloud webpage content and assist them in navigating through different pages, screens, sections, and interactive elements like form fields and controls.

Using a screen reader to test a website or app is one of many approaches to help us gain a different perspective on how others consume information and interact with it. It can help us to identify issues early on and address them as soon as possible.

## Choosing a screen readers to test with
Many screen readers are freely available, and are built-in to most operating systems for macOS, Android, iOS, iPadOS and Windows.

### Screen readers for Mac
VoiceOver is on all macOS computers as well as devices running iOS ot iPadOS. 

Follow the guidance relevant to your system on apple.com for how to enable it:

- [iPad VoiceOver guidance (external link)](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/ipad/ipad9a246749/ipados)

Sometimes new users of screen readers can find the voice output overwhelming to begin with if they're not dependent on it. You can use the VoiceOver Utility within System settings to change the voice, speech rate and even mute it temporarily if you need to.

## What should I be testing for?
Use a screen reader to check that all content is accessible by giving particular attention to a website's structure, images, buttons and form controls.

## Learn the keyboard shortcuts and touchscreen gestures
Screen readers include a predefined list of keyboard shortcuts and gestures, some of which can also be customised to user preference.

[Deque University provides a list of shortcuts and gestures](https://dequeuniversity.com/screenreaders/) for all the most popular screen readers and how to setup keyboard navigation where required for some web browsers.
