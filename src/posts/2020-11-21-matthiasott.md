Matthias Ott's website nearly meets grade AA overall aside from some issues with colour contrast for text placed directly over hero images along with some colours for headings and tags being to bright. Additionally the focus order for the Links archive doesn't have a sequential navigation order including an `<aside>` landmark nested inside of the `<article>`. Font sizing and line space are good and all links are underlined, making content easily readable and understandable.
