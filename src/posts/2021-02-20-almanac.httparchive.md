The Web Almanac almost meets grade AA overall. Navigational dropdowns function well to handle the large amount of content well for assistive technology users. Additionally, PDFs published on the site are accessible. For improvement: there are some reflow issues to address on most pages at increased zoom level and for smaller viewport sizes.
