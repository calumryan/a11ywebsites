Hidde de Vries' website almost meets grade AA overall with good colour choices and visible focus states. A few pages have low colour contrast on image captions, missing alternative text on avatars and orphaned labels for form controls. One of the headings uses `aria-label` with text that is not presented in the same way visually. There are also some small reflow issues with overflowing content at different screen sizes and zoom levels.
