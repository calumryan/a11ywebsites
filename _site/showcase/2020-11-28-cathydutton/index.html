<p>Cathy Dutton's website is pretty much a grade AA overall. There's an additional option for customising fonts and colours aimed at helping users with dyslexia and vision impairment. However, there are some reflow issues to address here for smaller screens or at increased zoom level. Some tab-based layouts need fixing to be keyboard navigable. Posts require some fixes to links without discernible text and some <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> elements have duplicate IDs.</p>
