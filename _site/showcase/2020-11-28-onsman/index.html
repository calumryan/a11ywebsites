<p>Ricky Onsman's website almost meets grade AA overall but needs some additional work to improve visibility of focus states and for viewing on smaller screens or at increased zoom level. The scroll to top button uses a none-focusable <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and the menu toggle has an <code>aria-expanded</code> property which doesn't update when expanded.</p>
